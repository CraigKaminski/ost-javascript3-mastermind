   * First I made sure the exact matches were counted correctly by setting the guess to
   * colors not present in the secret code and then set one color at a time correctly.
   *
   * Next I made sure colors resulting in an exact match were not being counted again in
   * a color only match. I did this by picking a color only present once in the secret
   * code and setting the exact match correctly in the guess and then a second time in
   * another position. The remaining colors in the guess were not present in the secret
   * code.
   *
   * Finally I made sure incorrect positioned colors were only matched once. Again I
   * set all the colors in the guess to values not present in the secret code. Then I 
   * picked a color present only once in the secret code and set it twice in the guess,
   * but not in the incorrect positions.
